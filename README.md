## Notice: I am on hiatus

My internet activities are currently reduced. I will still check emails and reply to them, but that's it.

This is a summary of my coding activity. For more info, visit [AustinHuang.me](https://austinhuang.me).

## Whatcha doin'?

* I mostly manage stuff rather than code stuff directly. I also try to improve open source tools that I personally use.
  * The only projects that I'm actively coding in is [Barinsta](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/barinsta) (ex-InstaGrabber). ([STM Shuttle Tracker](https://stm.austinhuang.me) is currently on hold as I contribute to [Transit Tracker Extras](https://github.com/transittracker/extras) instead.)
  * I have founded ![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Discord-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=white)-related projects like [DTel](https://github.com/dtel-hq/dtel) and [Discoin](https://github.com/discoin).
    * I am no longer as involved in Discord-related projects *as before*, since I have moved onto ![Matrix](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matrix-000000?logo=matrix&logoColor=white) (`@austin:privacytools.io`). You can see my rationale [here](https://austinhuang.me/discord-issues).
* I code in ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white) and ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-ED8B00?logo=java&logoColor=white).
  * Java is used for coding ![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Android-3DDC84?logo=android&logoColor=white) applications, and I use ![Android Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Android%20Studio-3DDC84?logo=android-studio&logoColor=white) for them.
  * For other stuff, I use ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Visual%20Studio%20Code-007acc?logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white).

## Where's the mandatory readme stats?

Fine. But really, numbers mean *nothing*, it's the quality that matters.
